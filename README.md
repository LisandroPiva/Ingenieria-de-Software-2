<p>This project 👨‍💼 was created by Leonardo Delmas, Geronimo Errante, Thiago Gauna Rubio, and Lisandro Piva. The project itself is about a website for making trades 💼 and completing exchanges at the hardware store 🔩 of a supposed client named Juan. Initially, we were surprised 😲 by the idea that our client wanted a bartering application as we had no idea how to build it, so we decided to interview him twice, asking him what he believed were the necessary features for the software to function and serve him well. The rest is history 📜, and you can see how the website turned out. 🔄🔨</p>
